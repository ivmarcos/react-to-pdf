# Installation

Get started with React to PDF by installing it in your React project.

## npm

Install using npm:

```bash
npm install react-to-pdf
```

## yarn

Or install using yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-to-pdf
```

## pnpm

Or install using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add react-to-pdf
```

## Verification

After installation, verify that the package is installed correctly by checking your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-to-pdf": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Peer Dependencies

React to PDF requires **React 16.8 or higher** (for hooks support). The library automatically includes its own dependencies:

- `html2canvas` - For capturing HTML content
- `jspdf` - For PDF generation

You don't need to install these separately.

## TypeScript Support

React to PDF is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. No need to install `@types/react-to-pdf` - it's already included!

If you're using TypeScript, you'll get full IntelliSense and type checking automatically:

```typescript
import { usePDF, Options } from 'react-to-pdf';

const options: Options = {
  filename: 'document.pdf',
  page: {
    format: 'a4',
    orientation: 'portrait'
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have React to PDF installed, you're ready to:

1. [Generate your first PDF](/react-to-pdf/docs/quick-start)
2. [Explore the API](/react-to-pdf/docs/api/hooks)
3. [Try the playground](/react-to-pdf/playground)

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found error

If you see a "Module not found" error after installation:

1. Make sure you've installed the package correctly
2. Restart your development server
3. Clear your node_modules and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Version conflicts

If you encounter peer dependency warnings with React:

- React to PDF supports React 16.8+
- Make sure your React version is compatible
- Check `npm ls react` to see which version is installed
