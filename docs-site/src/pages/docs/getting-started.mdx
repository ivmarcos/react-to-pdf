# Getting Started

Welcome to **React to PDF**! This library makes it simple to generate PDF documents from your React components with just a few lines of code.

## What is React to PDF?

React to PDF is a lightweight, powerful library that converts your React components into PDF documents. Whether you need to generate invoices, certificates, reports, or any other type of document, React to PDF provides an intuitive API that feels natural to React developers.

## Key Features

## How It Works

React to PDF uses the following approach to generate PDFs:

2. **Capture** - The library captures the rendered HTML using html2canvas
3. **Convert** - The captured content is converted to PDF using jsPDF
4. **Download** - The PDF is automatically downloaded or can be programmatically saved
