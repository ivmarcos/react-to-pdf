  {
    question: "What is React to PDF?",
    answer: "React to PDF is a library that allows you to generate PDF documents from React components. It uses html2canvas and jsPDF under the hood to capture your components and convert them to PDF format."
  },
  {
    question: "Which React versions are supported?",
    answer: "React to PDF supports React 16.8 and above (any version with hooks support). It works with React 16, 17, 18, and 19."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this in production?",
    answer: "Yes! React to PDF is production-ready with 55 tests, 48% code coverage, and is used by many applications in production."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work with TypeScript?",
    answer: "Yes, React to PDF is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions out of the box."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the PDF output?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You can customize page size, orientation, margins, scaling, and more. You have full control over the styling using CSS, Tailwind, or any CSS-in-JS solution."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I handle multi-page documents?",
    answer: "React to PDF automatically handles page breaks. When your content exceeds one page, it will automatically continue on subsequent pages."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add headers and footers?",
    answer: "Yes, use the Header and Footer components to add content that appears on every page of your PDF."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are images not showing in my PDF?",
    answer: "If images are from external domains, you need to enable CORS: set `canvas: { useCORS: true }` in your options. For local images, make sure they're properly loaded before generating the PDF."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I improve PDF quality?",
    answer: "Increase the canvas scale: `canvas: { scale: 3 }`. Higher scale values produce better quality but take longer to generate."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it free to use?",
    answer: "Yes! React to PDF is open source and released under the MIT License. You can use it freely in both personal and commercial projects."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I generate PDFs server-side?",
    answer: "React to PDF is designed for browser environments. For server-side PDF generation, consider using Puppeteer or similar tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How large can my PDFs be?",
    answer: "There's no hard limit, but very large PDFs (100+ pages) may be slow to generate. Consider pagination or splitting into multiple PDFs for better performance."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use custom fonts?",
    answer: "Yes! You can use Google Fonts, custom web fonts, or any fonts available in your application. See the Custom Fonts guide for details."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work with Next.js?",
    answer: "Yes, React to PDF works with Next.js. Make sure to use it in client components only (not server components)."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I report bugs or request features?",
    answer: "Open an issue on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/ivmarcos/react-to-pdf/issues"
  }
